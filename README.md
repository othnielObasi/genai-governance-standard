# Governing Generative AI in Production

This repository documents a **production-grade approach to governing Generative AI (GenAI)** — moving from baseline controls to practical application guidance and governance-oriented architectural patterns.

It is intended for:
- Engineering teams
- Security and risk leaders
- Product managers
- Auditors and reviewers
- Architects designing GenAI platforms

This work is **vendor-neutral**, **architecture-aware**, and designed to support **safe, reviewable, and auditable GenAI deployments**.

## Scope & Positioning

This repository focuses on:
- **What must be true** for GenAI systems to be production-ready
- **How baseline controls can be applied consistently in practice**
- **How governance responsibilities should be represented at the architectural level**

---

## Out of Scope

This repository defines baseline controls, practical artefacts, and conceptual architecture.

Tool-specific implementations, runtime enforcement mechanisms, and operational procedures are **out of scope** and must be designed and validated in accordance with organisational context and risk profile.
