# Governing Generative AI in Production

This repository documents a **production-grade approach to governing Generative AI (GenAI)** — moving from high-level controls to practical implementation guidance and enforceable system design.

It is intended for:
- Engineering teams
- Security and risk leaders
- Product managers
- Auditors and reviewers
- Architects designing GenAI platforms

This work is **vendor-neutral**, **architecture-aware**, and designed to support **safe, reviewable, and auditable GenAI deployments**.

> We publish the standards. We consult on enforcement.

## Scope & Positioning

This repository focuses on:
- **What must be true** for GenAI systems to be production-ready
- **How teams can implement controls in practice**
- **How systems should be architected to enforce governance**

It does **not** include:
- Runtime enforcement implementations
- Policy engines or DSLs
- Incident runbooks
- Organisation-specific thresholds

Those are intentionally reserved for internal and consulting work.
