# GenAI Production Readiness Standard

## Purpose

This checklist defines **minimum conditions for approving GenAI systems for production use**.

If any item cannot be satisfied, the system is **not production-ready**.

---

## Core Questions

- Can we explain what the system is allowed to do?
- Can we stop it if necessary?
- Can we reconstruct what happened after an incident?
- Can we govern exceptions?

If the answer to any is “no”, approval should not be granted.

---

## Positioning

This standard is:
- vendor-neutral
- architecture-aware
- enforceable in principle

It is intended to support executive sign-off, audit readiness, and operational confidence.
