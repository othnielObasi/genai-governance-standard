# Contributing

This repository documents a public GenAI governance standard and architectural reference.

Contributions are welcome in the form of:
- Clarifications
- Editorial improvements
- Non-vendor-specific examples
- Issue reports and discussion

We do not accept:
- Tool-specific implementations
- Runtime enforcement code
- Organisation-specific thresholds

All contributions must align with the vendor-neutral and architecture-agnostic intent of the project.
