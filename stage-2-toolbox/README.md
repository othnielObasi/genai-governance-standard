# Stage 2 — Practical GenAI Control Toolbox


## Overview

Stage 2 translates the Stage 1 control baseline into **practical artefacts that teams can use during design, build, and review**.

It answers the question:

> How can baseline GenAI controls be applied consistently in practice?

This toolbox is intentionally **implementation-agnostic** and designed for **broad reuse across organisations and environments**.

---

## What This Stage Provides

For each control area, this stage includes:

- control intent  
- applicability guidance  
- example artefacts  
- validation checklists  
- common failure patterns  

These elements are intended to support **consistent interpretation and application** of the baseline controls defined in Stage 1.

## Example Control Pack

### Control Pack: Use-Case Definition

**Intent**  
Ensure GenAI systems are deployed only for approved, understood purposes.

**Applicability**  
All GenAI systems.

**Example Artefacts**
- Use-case description  
- Intended users  
- Prohibited uses  
- Risk classification  

**Validation Checklist**
- Is the use-case documented?
- Are prohibited uses explicit?
- Is scope aligned with the declared system architecture?

**Common Failures**
- “General assistant” with no defined boundaries  
- Scope expanding after deployment without review  

---

## Scope Boundary

This stage focuses on **documentation, design-time artefacts, and review guidance**.

Tool-specific implementations, runtime enforcement mechanisms, and operational procedures are **out of scope** and must be designed in accordance with organisational context and risk profile.

---

## Intended Use

- Engineering onboarding  
- Product and system design  
- Security and risk reviews  
- Consistent internal documentation across teams
